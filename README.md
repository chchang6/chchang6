- 👋 Hi, I’m @chchang6 on Github, and Chris Chang in real life.
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of scalable computing, the natural sciences, computational science and engineering, and machine learning.
Secret desire to get guru on scientific Python and passable in C++. Also woodworking and music composition.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole bunch of stuff, including Irish, finite element methods, and always more about electrons and molecules. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a case by case basis. My main coding interest at the moment is modernizing ScaBiKinS, a fork and reboot of the
[High-Performance Systems Biology Toolkit](http://cscads.rice.edu/tahoe_workshop_pgraf_7-09.pdf) for large-scale kinetic network simulation and optimization.
I'm also interested in open-source scientific software in general.
