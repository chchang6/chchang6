- 👋 Hi, I’m @chchang6 on Github, and Chris Chang in real life.
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of scalable computing, the natural sciences, computational science and engineering, quantum computing, and machine learning.
Also woodworking and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole bunch of stuff, including machine learning and AI, quantum computing, and always more about electrons, molecules, and materials. 
- 💞️ Happy to collaborate on a case by case basis, particularly on open-source scientific software. Also doing a lot of cloud work as a consultant with AWS Professional Services.
- 📫 You can reach me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/datainfoknowledgewisdom/), ResearchGate, or by e-mail at christopher 0x002e chang
